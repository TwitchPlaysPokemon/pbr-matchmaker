mergeable:
################
    # Settings that depend heavily on the modes (metagames / gimmicks) and factors (see one_move_per_pokemon and team_choice) that are present in the match.  Each mode/factor specifies its own subset of settings.  An algorithm then merges these subsets together, along with a subset of default setting values, to determine the final values for these settings.

    # Settings must be contained within "priority brackets", which are simply numeric keys between 0 and 7 inclusive.  For any given setting, a value in a higher bracket overrides a value in a lower bracket. If >1 value is present in the highest bracket present, the resolution is setting-dependent (see default settings below).

    # Example:
    #
    # Mode 1 settings:
    #     2:
    #         bet_bonus: 15
    #     3:
    #         switching: .75
    #
    # Mode 2 settings:
    #     2:
    #         bet_bonus: 45
    #     7:
    #         switching: permanently_disabled
    #
    # For a match with both modes 1 and 2:
    # - switching will be `permanently_disabled` because that value is in a higher bracket (7 > 3).
    # - The bet_bonus will be 15%, because bet bonus conflicts are resolved by "lowest wins" (15 < 45).
